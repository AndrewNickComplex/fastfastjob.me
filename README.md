Actually we can do our documentations and specifications on github through md.
Don't have to worry bout push and pulls if we directly edit on github as well.

As to whether it's more or less efficient, idk. It's less pretty than gdocs that's for sure. But it's one less platform to link here and there to, which saves time.
